# tech-stacks-collection

## Description

A collection of different tech stacks to build an identical CRUD application with modular frontend, backend, database, and deployment components.

## Tech Stacks

- [x] Flask - React

- [x] Spring Boot - React
- [ ] Django - React
- [ ] NestJS - React
- [ ] NextJS
- [ ] ASP.NET Core
- [ ] Express - Angular

# Project MVP

## Frontend

- (/) A landing page that contains:
    - value passed from the backend (ex. Home Page)
    - button redirecting to the form page

- (/form) A form page that contains:
    - title	
    - input field
    - ‘add todo’ button
    - dynamic display of todos in the database
    - dynamically rendered ‘update todo’ button
    - dynamically rendered delete todo’ button

## Backend

- URL endpoint to test access (ex. /helloworld)
- A value passed to the frontend directly as a string from the backend (w/o db access)
- Create, read, update and delete endpoints

```http
GET /helloworld
GET /
GET /todo
GET /todo/:id
POST /todo
PUT /todo/:id
DELETE /todo/:id
```

## Database

- Filled with one value automatically 
- Transitioning from a local to a cloud-base database upon deployment
- Either SQL or NoSQL solutions
- Fundamentally simple design

```sql
CREATE TABLE todos (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(255)
);
```

## Container

Using Docker to:
- create a frontend image (/backend/Dockerfile)
- create a backend image (/frontend/Dockerfile)
- create a Docker compose file (/docker-compose.yml)


## Cloud Deployment

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
- Docker - AWS ECR - AWS ECS (Fargate)
- Docker - Kubernetes
- AWS EC2 (Autoscaling and Load Balancing)

# Branches

- development: locally running applications 
- docker: applications running in a container and configured with Docker
- elastic-beanstalk: applications configured and deployed with Elastic Beanstalk
- aws-ecs: applications configured and deployed with AWS ECR & AWS ECS
- aws-ec2: applications configured and deployed with AWS EC2
- kubernetes: applications configured and deployed with Kubernetes

# General Notes

- Frontends/Backends/Databases self-contained and modular (providing re-use and rapid development)
- No Styling
- Identical Application

# Potential Future Integrations

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- S3
- MongoDB
- AWS Lambda and API Gateway
